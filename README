Asciiquarium is an aquarium/sea animation in ASCII art.

Installation
------------

Asciiquarium is a single perl script, so all you have to do is make sure
it's executable and put it somewhere convenient, like /usr/local/bin or
/usr/local/games.

Requirements
------------

Asciiquarium depends on the Term::Animation perl module, which depends on
Curses. You can get both modules from http://search.cpan.org. This program
will only run on platforms that have a Curses library (so it won't work on
Windows, but you might get it to run under cygwin).

Installing dependencies on debian/ubuntu:
sudo apt install perl-modules libcurses-perl && sudo cpan -i Term::Animation

  -v --version      Print version and exit
