## Installation

Asciiquarium is a single perl script, so all you have to do is make sure
it's executable and put it somewhere convenient, like `/usr/local/bin` or
`/usr/local/games`.

### Dependencies

Asciiquarium depends on the Term::Animation perl module, which depends on
Curses. You can get both modules from http://search.cpan.org. This program
will only run on platforms that have a Curses library (so it won't work on
Windows, but you might get it to run under cygwin).

Installing dependencies on debian/ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install perl-modules libcurses-perl
sudo cpan -i Term::Animation
```

## Usage

```
Options:
  -c --classic      Only show species from Asciiquarium 1.0
  -t --transparent  Transparent background
  -s --screensaver  Exit on any keypress
  -h --help         Print help and exit
  -v --version      Print version and exit

Hotkeys:
  q  quit
  r  redraw
  p  pause
```
